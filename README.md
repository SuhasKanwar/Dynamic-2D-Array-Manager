# Dynamic-2D-Array-Manager
This project leverages the fundamental concept of 2D arrays, providing a versatile platform for users to input, customize, search, and filter data in real-time. Dynamic data structure management ensures a smooth experience for handling complex datasets. Dive into the efficiency of customizable 2D arrays for powerful data manipulation.

Student Database Management System

Introduction

This C++ program implements a simple Student Database Management System. The system allows users to perform various operations, including entering student data, displaying the database, searching for a student's information, editing existing data, filtering data based on specific criteria, and exiting the program.

Features

Data Input: Users can enter student information, including admission number, name, age, and marks. The data is stored in a 2D array.

Data Output: Users can view the entire student database, displaying admission numbers, names, ages, and marks.

Search Functionality: Users can search for a specific student's information by entering the admission number.

Data Editing: Users can modify the existing data for a student by specifying the admission number and choosing which field (Name, Age, or Marks) to edit.

Filtering Data:

Users can filter data based on the student's name, displaying all records with a matching name.

Users can filter data based on age or marks using comparison operators (> , < , = , >= , <=).

User-Friendly Menu: The program provides a menu-driven interface, allowing users to select the desired operation.

Looping Mechanism: The program continues to execute until the user chooses to exit, providing a continuous user experience.

Usage

Run the program.

Choose from the menu options to perform various operations.
